                                This artifact was selected for its data structure and the algorithms used within it. This code is using Python as a RESTFUL API and a database. This was work I did with a course before this one. This code is still fresh in my mind and I have some ideas as what I can do to enhance it.

								I decided to go with this code instead of the one I originally chosen because this one shows some good skill with python and showed some opportunity for improvement. I am pretty good strong on python but this offered me an opportunity to grow my skills in python and use a NoSQL database. Looking over this code I was seeing what I could enhance or fix perhaps if required. The one enhancement I can try to accomplish is the securing of the initiation of the client. This is something that I missed and wanted to do in the course but ran out of time. Most of the other enhancements will be tighten up the functions and ensure there are try and catch error handling.

								While working on this code it was challenging trying to figure the best way to initialize a session then ensure everything downstream of it worked. I want to say it is best practice to ensure this works this way. It was challenging to make sure that the API calls where clean and secure. The data structure was pretty decent and not much I had to do there but I still reviewed it to be sure. Challenges are just opportunities for improvement and growth.
