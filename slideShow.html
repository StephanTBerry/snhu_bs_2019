                                The artifact I chose for this milestone is one with using a Java Server side along with a framework aspect. This java code was designed to implement some framework design around Java tools. I created this artifact a year ago for my core Computer Science course 250. This was an actual software development life cycle course. This course showed the life cycle of starting a project, working with a customer and making the suggested changes.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>
                                The reason I selected this code was it shows exactly what this milestone is asking. It was a life cycle course and this code shows the changes that would have been reflected in that. This selection of code shows an understanding of Java and its use as a lightweight framework. It shows how I was able to utilize some tools within its available classes. Portions of this code that could be showcased are those showing how we can tighten up the methods that obtain data from folders. Other parts are to show how we close up some methods. I improved this code by making a folder crawler and obtaining a list of file names to be used. The file name has to be saved according to specs for the folder. The other enhancement was to add a color chooser method. This was to allow the user to chose the background color of the site. This could be utilized by the customer and hidden normal.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>
                                The outcome for this milestone, I feel was accomplished. I used this same code for the review and in that review I mentioned the enhancements I wanted to accomplish. The outcomes I planned for was to enhance the code and fix some of the existing ones. Enhancements was cleaning up the method for picture file names. The enhancement was to add in a color chooser and the ability to build an array on file names in a particular folder. 
                            </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>
                                During the process I had to overcome some challenges about what tools to use, how to use them and where to deploy them. The biggest challenge I had to overcome was finding the right tool within the Java class, to get a means to open and look inside a folder for files. Then when I was able to use this new method, what options I have within it to use if fully. I was able to ask for files by a specific file extension type, which helped in making sure I grab the right files and not someone putting the wrong on in and using it.
