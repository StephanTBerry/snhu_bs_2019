                            	In this milestone I chose the class DAD-220 which was a class based on introduction and use of rational databases. This course was about a year ago and the work done here was a good building foundation on a topic I have had previous experience on. In my everyday I started out with learning a Rational Database the likes of PostgreSQL. I built my knowledge where ever I got the chance and continue to this day. This course offered some insight to tools and methods I have not used before with a database that I had not used before.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span> 
								The reason or main reason I chose to include this in my ePortfolio is because it shows that I can do database level work. This shows as part of my career choice as a full stack developer, to show that I can do database level work. Parts of the code that would showcase my abilities is the rerunnable sections. These sections show that this code is smart and accounts for other developers whom might add to it, so no duplications happen during a burn in period. If the team has tests setup where it runs this for rerunnable, it wonâ€™t fail. The biggest enhancement of this code is that it was originally written for MySQL and now is written for PostgreSQL. What that means really is that this code is transportable between two different Rational Databases but are somewhat similar.

								In Milestone One I mentioned that I would simply enhance the written code with tighten up some queries. I then decided to rewrite what I had to, in order to make it work for PostgreSQL. I have taken some functions written by someone else, given credit in the code, that makes altering tables, adding tables and such, verified and adds to the rerunnable factor. I met my Milestone One plans and feel I surpassed them with changing it up a bit. 
							</span>
						</p>

								During the process of this enhancement, I was very comfortable with working in databases. I have been working with databases for some time, in all actuality it was my foot into the door for software. I have worked in Rational Databases for a few years and really took to it. This work was cool and gave me the opportunity to see what it could take to change some code written for one, to use for the other.
